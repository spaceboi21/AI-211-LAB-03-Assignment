All codes are from the assignment Lab 03, for tasks requiring ranges and time slot, i havent updated the ranges as my jupyter had reached an output limit and kept crashing.

To succesfully run those files, please decrease the range and change the variables li and root accordingly.


The video I made is more than 3 hours long sir, it is very difficult to upload it online, therefore do ask me for the videos when required.



Graphviz required to be installed manually and added to the windows path, therefore it took too much time. however i did do my research and can explain the workings.
